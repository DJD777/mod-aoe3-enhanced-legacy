# Age of Empires 3: Enhanced Legacy Edition

## **Note: This is the repository page for the full Enhanced Legacy mod for Age of Empires 3 (Legacy), which includes all the features of other standalone versions. See "Installation Instructions" below.**
See THESE repositories for the other standalone versions.

## What does this mod do?
This mod was designed to *enhance* the Legacy (original 2007) version of Age of Empires 3, rather than *overhaul* the vanilla experience. No civs were altered except to make visual improvements, while the new civ additions were crafted to feel like they were a part of the original game. All other enhancements are unobtrusive and/or optional. Overall, the core design philosophy was to make what feels like a new, seamless mini-expansion of the original game.

## List of features:
- Adds 2 new civilizations: the **Maltese** and **Americans**.
- Enhances AI with a customized version of DraugurAI to make CPU players more versatile, efficient, and competitive.
- Improves graphics with added blood and corpse effects, an AI-upscaled UI, optional AI-upscaled building textures, and now nearly all unit upgrades will reflect with visual changes.
- Adds more high-qulity, fitting music to the gameplay soundtrack, for a nearly 2-hour long loop, with a carefully ordered playlist that separates the soundtrack into European, Native, and Asian flavors, before transitional music sets up the start of the loop (similar to the Age of Empires II: Conquerors Expansion's soundtrack).
- Optional singleplayer-only, randomized, historcally-representative, and civ-appropriate music tracks and Explorer audio kick off each new random map game. 
- Fixes minor visual, text, and audio bugs, such as misspellings, potrait/icon discrepancies, and missing unit audio.
- Introduces minor gameplay changes, including a third wall upgrade, increased Homecity level rewards and card deck limits, and new Homecity customizations for all civs.
- Everything new was made with historicity and uniformity in mind--from visual unit upgrades, to tech names, to the soundtrack's play order.
- Includes modder's resources, like a compendium of useful tricks and information I learned during the making of the mod, as well as tools to help the new AoE3 modder.

## New Civilzations Overview
### Maltese
Civilization that specializes in defense, healing capabilities, and archaic units. Certain buildings and units generate a new resource called Favor, which they use to request special Homecity shipments and train units at Auberges. Builds Hospitals to heal, defend, train healers, and generate Favor; builds Auberges to form associations with one of the Grand Priories, each with their own unique bonuses and units. Certain Homecity cards can send enormous Fixed Gun Barrels, which can be built over Fixed Gun Platforms, giving tremendous firepower to whomever controls the area. Best units: Hoop Thrower, Hospitaller, Knight.

### Americans
Civilization that specializes in Age-up bonuses, economic capabilities, and gunpowder units. Certain units gather a new resource called Favor, which they use to research bonus-providing Policies. Policies are unlocked via new Age Politicians from the Fortress Age and up. Builds Legislatures, which research Policies and train Favor-gathering Representatives. Builds Homesteads instead of Houses and Livestock Pens, and which spawn Minutemen when built. Minutemen do not lose health over time. Ages unlock resource-specialized Settlers. Livestock Pens train Cows and Ranchers. Best units: Continental Regular, American Dragoon, Rifleman.
