This pack contains vanilla and other textures upscaled to 2x their original resolution in most cases, and to a maximum resolution of 2048x2048. It's not comprehensive, but I upscaled all the ones that looked the worst to me.
Note: Installing the HD Texture pack may cause severe lag when there's many buildings or units on-screen at once. This is a limitation of the game engine. May not be MP compatible.
