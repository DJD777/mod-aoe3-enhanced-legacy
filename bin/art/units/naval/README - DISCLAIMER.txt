-- DISCLAIMER --

Contained within this archive are the model and texture files
for ship attachments made to fit Age of Empires III's Galleon
and Frigate models. These models and textures were made by
Robert Faber aka peugeot407, and are free to be used, modified
and distributed by the general public, so long as the original
creator is attributed, and a copy of this file is included.

-- README --

To make these models and textures work, simply place the folder
named "units" in the game's Art folder, and if prompted, allow
it to overwrite existing folders (no original game files will
be overwritten). Changing the location of the files will make
the textures not show up in the game, so please do not do so.
When creating an animfile, simply make a new attachment section,
and attach said attachment to the ATTACHPOINT bone. Other base-
level bones might also work, but ATTACHPOINT is guaranteed to
work, as that is the bone that was used during the orientation
of the model.

Enjoy!
