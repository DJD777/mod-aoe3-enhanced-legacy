----INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS----

	Follow these instructions CAREFULLY and IN ORDER. If you have mods installed, a clean installation (reinstalled AoE3 from scratch with no mods) is recommended if planning on playing multiplayer. Also make sure all players have followed the exact same steps outlined here, and have no other mods installed.

	1) Cleanly install AoE3 via Steam. I.e., if you've modded your game before, uninstall your game via Steam, completely empty your game's "bin" folder (found in Steam's "common" -> "Age of Empires 3"), and reinstall it via Steam.

	2) Run the game through Steam. Choose to run The Asian Dynasties, then quit at the main menu.

	3) Now either 
		a) Run "ESOC Patch 9.0.0.1-UC1.exe" from my mod's folder and install the patch into your game's directory, OR
		b) download ESOC Patch: Unchained from    https://eso-community.net/download/file.php?type=unchained&patch=latest  OR 
		c) go to    https://eso-community.net/esoc-patch.php   and download ESOC Patch: Unchained yourself. Make sure it's the Unchained link, and version 9.0.0.1.

	4) Go to the game's directory by right-clicking it in Steam -> Manage -> Browse local files. 

	5) Go to "bin" -> "data" and delete "stringtabley.xml.xmb" (this overwrites my mod's file, and there's a backup in DataPY.bar, anyway).

	6) COPY or CUT the "bin" folder in my mod's folder, and PASTE it into the game's root directory (you should see the game's original "bin" folder in there). Overwrite all files when prompted.

	7) Go into my mod's "Optional" -> "4GB Patcher (from NTCore)" folders and patch the "age3f.exe" executable to use more VRAM. This is considered optional but is highly recommended. In MP, all players should either have patched their executable, or not. A mix of patched/unpatched may or may not cause mismatch errors. See the Readme.txt in that folder for more instructions.

		a) If you plan on playing singleplayer exclusively, the singleplayer-only maps found in "Optional" -> "Maps - Singleplayer Only" are highly recommended. See the Readme.txt in that folder for more info.

		b) There are experimental HD buildings textures found in "Optional" -> "HD Buildings Textures". They may cause lag and/or Out of Sync errors in singleplayer and/or multiplayer. All players should probably have the same files (i.e., with or without them). See the Readme.txt found in that folder for more info.


----UNINSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS----
	
	1) Uninstall the game cleanly via Steam.
	
	2) Delete the "bin" folder leftover in the game's main directory.

	3) Reinstall the game via Steam.
